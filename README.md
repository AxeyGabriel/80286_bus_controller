# 80286_bus_controller
GAL22V10 working as 80286 bus controller aka. 80C288

Was meant to be used in a homemade 80286 single board computer

I dont remember the state of this project\
I was 15 years old when i wrote this

I was ready to attach the GAL to a running\
80286 board but i killed the board and then the project\
stopped.
